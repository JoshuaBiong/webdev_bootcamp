# Scenario

After few days that I process my resegnation as an Account Associate at a BPO company here I am now back in track to pursue my goal to be a web dev / mobile dev / software engineer 

want to start from the scratch since I already have a foundation of the basic web dev such as html css and javascript and wanted to create an simple project such as:

simple calculator 
bmi calculator
tiktaktoe
snake game
gym site
portfolio

 using pure html css and javascript and after that i am planning to proceed on learning react js by transforming those projects in a react framework
